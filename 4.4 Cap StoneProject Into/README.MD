"Angela is just incredible, awesome and just fantastic in this course. I've never had such an instructor; detailed in every aspect of the course, gives precise explanations, gives you the anxiety to learn etc. She's got that ability to make fun while explaining things for better understanding. I really love this course." - Ekeu MonkamUlrich

"Angela is very thorough without ever being boring. I've taken MANY online courses in my life including my Bachelors and Masters degrees. She is by far the best instructor I've ever had. This course is packed with thousands of dollars worth of great instruction, and paced well enough for anyone to pick coding up and run with it- Thank you!" - J Carlucci

"Love the way Angela explains things. Easy to follow and full of logic. I can say she must have spent a lot of energy creating this great course. Thank you and I recommend it to all who's interested in coding!" - Yiqing Zheng

"So far (on my third day) this course has taught me more than I was able to learn in multiple other programming courses. This course is clearly outlined and builds upon itself gradually in an easy to understand way." - Normal Ramsey

"This course will take you from beginner to intermediate level for real. If you don't know how to put together the pieces of web development this is what you're looking for. Angela explains in an amazing way by creating projects all the way during this course, explaining the concepts in real practice. Thank you very much, Angela. I will always consider you my mentor. Look forward to taking more courses with you." - Moises Dionisio Cruz

"An amazing course, perfect for absolute beginners at the start of their coding journey! Angela is an amazing tutor and can explain in the most simple and comprehensible way even complex coding notions. Learning web development cannot get any more fun!" - Zoe Moyssoglou

"It's a different approach to teaching Web Development. I like that you are given everything possible to succeed from the onset." - Ronick Thomas

The tutor is simply AMAZING, by far the best tutor I have ever had. I would give her 10 stars out of 5. She is not just punching the code and talking to herself, but she is actually explaining things. She keeps on giving really useful hints and she will give you a great load of other references. I always knew what I was doing and why I was doing it. All the extra challenges have just made me remember and understand things better. - Peter Dlugos

Instructor

Dr. Angela Yu
Developer and Lead Instructor

I'm Angela, I'm a developer with a passion for teaching. I'm the lead instructor at the London App Brewery, London's leading Programming Bootcamp. I've helped hundreds of thousands of students learn to code and change their lives by becoming a developer. I've been invited by companies such as Twitter, Facebook and Google to teach their employees.

My first foray into programming was when I was just 12 years old, wanting to build my own Space Invader game. Since then, I've made hundred of websites, apps and games. But most importantly, I realised that my greatest passion is teaching.

I spend most of my time researching how to make learning to code fun and make hard concepts easy to understand. I apply everything I discover into my bootcamp courses. In my courses, you'll find lots of geeky humour but also lots of explanations and animations to make sure everything is easy to understand.

I'll be there for you every step of the way.

Requirements
In order to keep the project within scope (time, energy, resource), you can only use HTML to complete thing project. Even if you know CSS and JS (which we're assuming you don't yet), you are expected to only write the website using HTML.

Imagine you are a professional developer working on this project. There will be things you don't know, things you want to do but haven't yet learnt how to. As a professional developer, you need to know the limits of your abilities and look up other things in Google, MDN docs, the internet.



FAQs
1. Can I use these Capstone projects in my job interviews?

Yes! That's the point of these capstone projects. Unlike course projects, which have solution code and video walkthroughs, Capstone Projects are meant to be entirely your "own work". There are over a million students who have enrolled on this web development course worldwide. If you add a course project to your portfolio, it's very likely that your client will know it's from this course. The capstone projects on the other hand, have no solution code, no walk through, no design specs. It's it purely your creation So it can definitely be counted as your own work and be added to your portfolio.

When I hire developers, I always ask for a portfolio. I consider what they have built by themselves to be far more important than which University they went to or if they have a computer science degree. Many of my friends who are CEOs in multi-nationals and startups agree.



2. What if I don't remember how to do something, even though I watched all the videos?

Watching a video is often not enough to learn a skill. That's why these capstone projects are a great opportunity to identify your weak points. While you're building, you'll find yourself stuck or forgetting how to do things. Great! It's then time to review previous lessons or online documentation to fill your knowledge gaps.
